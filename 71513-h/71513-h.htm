</div>

<p>The following pages contain a translation
with some omissions, of the Slavonic service
book entitled, <i>Trébnik</i>, or, <i>Book of Needs</i>, so
called, because it contains the provision for
that which is spiritually needed by a Christian
from the cradle to the grave.</p>

<p>To this is added, as an appendix, a translation
of a portion of the service book entitled,
<i>Chinóvnik archieréiskaho svyashtshennosloujéniya</i>,
or, <i>Office book of the bishop’s holy service</i>, namely,
that pertaining to the laying on of hands.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The original used for the translation of the
first named work is an edition published in
Moscow in the year 1882, and that for the
portion of the second, one published in the
same city in the year 1890.</p>

<p>The omissions, made under competent advice,
in the translation of <i>Trébnik</i> are as follows,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="intro_Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span></p>

<p>I. The entire of the epistle and gospel
lessons, these being indicated by their initial
and concluding words only, with one exception,
namely, in the office of the sanctification of
water on the festival of the Epiphany, where
the lessons from the prophecy being written at
length those of the epistle and gospel are made
to correspond.</p>

<p>II. Questions asked of penitents in the confessional,
and instructions concerning the imposition
of penance, as explained in foot-notes
at pages <a href="#Footnote_11">49</a> and <a href="#Footnote_12">51</a>.</p>

<p>III. Some prayers for various occasions
which are not of general interest (chapters
xxii, xxiii, xxx, xxxi, xxxii, xxxiv, xxxv,
xxxvi, xxxvii, xxxviii, xxxix, xl, and xli).</p>

<p>IV. Extracts from the Nomocanon (chap.
xlii), many of which refer to obsolete heathen
customs and habits, and all need the living
voice of the pastors of the church for their
proper present application.</p>

<p>V. The Kalendar and the Paschal Tables
(chapters xliii and xliv), these having been
given in the translator’s former work, <i>Euchology</i>,
published in Kidderminster in the year 1891.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="intro_Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span></p>

<p>It should be understood that the originals
are books for the use of those who are conversant
with the order of the church service,
and that, for that reason, many abbreviations
appear in them, well known prayers, verses, etc,
being indicated by initial words only, or by
ecclesiastical terms. As these abbreviations
have been imitated in the translations, some
notes are given, which, it is hoped, may remove
most of the obscurities, which, to the general
reader, might appear to pervade the work.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Aër.</i> The external veil which is used to
cover both chalice and paten.</p>

<p><i>Antidoron.</i> That which remains of a <i>Prosphora</i>
(loaf of oblation) after the portion for consecration
has been cut from it. This remainder
is given to communicants (together with wine
and warm water) immediately after the holy
sacrament, and is also distributed to those of
the congregation who are not communicants at
the end of the Liturgy instead of the holy gifts
themselves, and, for that reason, it is called
<i>Antidoron</i>. In the primitive church its distribution
was known under the term <i>Agape</i>, <i>i.e.</i>,
Love-feast.</p>

<p><i>Axios.</i> Worthy. An exclamation, referring
to the candidates, used at ordinations.</p>

<p><i>Canon.</i> An ecclesiastical composition, commemorative
of any given festival or occasion,
consisting of nine spiritual songs, according to
the number of the degrees of the incorporeal<span class="pagenum"><a id="intro_Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span>
hosts, based upon these nine scriptural odes, or
prayers, I. The song of Moses in Exodus (<i>chap.
xv.</i> 1-19). II. The song of Moses in Deuteronomy
(<i>chap. xxxii.</i> 1-43). This song, being
indicative of God’s judgment against sinners, is
sung only in penitential seasons, hence a Canon
usually lacks the second Ode, the third following
immediately on the first. III. The prayer of
Anna (<i>1 Kings ii.</i> 1-10). IV. The prayer of
Abbacum (<i>chap. iii.</i> 2 <i>ad fin.</i>). V. The prayer
of Esaias (<i>chap. xxvi.</i> 9-20). VI. The prayer
of Jonas (<i>chap. ii.</i> 2-9). VII. The prayer of
the Three Children (<i>Daniel iii</i>). VIII. The
song of the same (<i>Benedicite</i>). IX. The song
of Zacharias (<i>Benedictus</i>), preceded by that of
the Virgin (<i>Magnificat</i>). Every Ode in a
Canon is preceded by a verse called <i>Irmos</i>,
itself being the rhythmical model of the verses
that follow, which are called <i>Troparia</i>, because
they turn upon a model. The <i>Irmos</i> however
is frequently omitted, or is sung only before
Odes iii, vi, and ix (as also after these). See
pages <a href="#Page_210">210</a>, <a href="#Page_214">214</a>, and <a href="#Page_218">218</a>. A refrain pervades
all the Odes. See pages <a href="#Page_129">129</a>, <a href="#Page_183">183</a>, and <a href="#Page_209">209</a>.
The refrains for the Canons at pages <a href="#Page_85">85</a> and
<a href="#Page_145">145</a> are not expressed in the text, but these are
respectively, “Have mercy upon me, O God,
have mercy upon me,” and, “Rest, O Lord,
thy sleeping servant’s soul.” The refrain is
sung or said between every verse except the
last two, “Glory to the Father, and to the Son,<span class="pagenum"><a id="intro_Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span>
and to the Holy Ghost,” being prefixed to the
last but one, and “Both now and ever, and to
ages of ages. Amen” to the last, which last is
always addressed to the God-bearing Virgin.
Sometimes, <i>e.g.</i>, in penitential seasons, the
verses of the Odes are sung together with those
of their scriptural prototypes, and the rubric
then indicates to how many of these verses,
counting backwards from the last, the ecclesiastically
composed ones are to be subjoined.
Thus at page <a href="#Page_128">128</a> the Canon is directed to be
sung to vi, <i>i.e.</i>, six verses (counting backwards)
of the scriptural prototype in each Ode; but in
this case, if so sung, the refrain would be
omitted. A Canon is moreover usually divided
into three parts, the division taking place after
the third and sixth Odes, a verse called
<i>Kathisma</i>, or one called <i>Hypacoë</i>, frequently
occurring after Ode iii, and one called
<i>Condakion</i>, followed by one or more called
<i>Icos</i> (<i>pl.</i> <i>Icosi</i>) after Ode vi. Sometimes an
epistle and gospel lection occurs after the
<i>Condakion</i> and <i>Icos</i>. See page <a href="#Page_167">167</a>. Finally, it
is to be remarked that an <i>Ectenia</i> (q. v.) usually
follows Ode iii (before the <i>Kathisma</i>), Ode vi
(before the <i>Condakion</i> and <i>Icos</i>), and Ode ix.</p>

<p><i>Cherubic Hymn.</i> The song sung at the great
Introit in the celebration of the Liturgy, when
the prepared gifts are solemnly carried from the
<i>Prothesis</i> (table of oblations) through the church
to the altar. The words of the ancient song<span class="pagenum"><a id="intro_Page_xiv"></a>[xiv]</span>
accompanying this rite are as follows,</p>

<p>Let all mortal flesh be still, and let it stand
in fear and awe, and think of nothing earthly to
itself, because the King of kings and Lord of
lords approacheth to be slain, and given for the
faithful’s food.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Here the procession takes place.</i>)</p>

<p>Him do precede th’ angelic choirs, with all
their principals and powers, the cherubim of
many eyes, and the six-winged seraphim, who
shade their faces and sing forth the song,
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.</p>

<p>These words however are now only sung on
Holy Saturday, and, except on that day, and on
Holy Thursday, and at the Liturgy of the
Presanctified, are substituted by the following,
dating from the time of Justinian,</p>

<p>We, who the cherubim in mystery represent
and sing the song thrice-holy to the quickening
Trinity, should put away now every care of life,</p>

<p class="center">(<i>The procession.</i>)</p>

<p>That we the King of all things may receive,
who borne in is on spears by angel ranks
unseen. Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.</p>

<p>On Holy Thursday the words are,</p>

<p>Of thy mysterious supper, Son of God, me a
communicant accept to-day; for I thy mystery
to thy foes will not betray, nor give to thee a
kiss as Judas did; but, as the thief, I will confess
thee: Lord, in thy kingdom O remember
me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="intro_Page_xv"></a>[xv]</span></p>

<p class="center">(<i>The procession.</i>)</p>

<p>Of thy mysterious supper.... <i>the whole
again, concluding with the thrice sung Alleluia</i>.</p>

<p>And at the Liturgy of the Presanctified,</p>

<p>Now serve the heavenly powers unseen with
us; for, lo, the King of glory cometh in. Behold,
the mystic sacrifice, that perfected hath
been, is borne in on the spears.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>The procession.</i>)</p>

<p>Let us draw near with faith and love, that we
of life immortal may partakers be. Alleluia,
alleluia, alleluia.</p>

<p><i>Condakion.</i> A short verse expressing the
purport of any given festival or occasion. See
Canon.</p>

<p><i>Dismissal.</i> The concluding words of an office.
A full form of these is given at page <a href="#Page_222">222</a>, but in
other places, when they are expressed at all, it
is in a more or less fragmentary manner.</p>

<p><i>Ectenia.</i> A form of prayer consisting of a
number of rogations with responses. There is
a great, and a little Ectenia, an Ectenia of
earnest prayer, and one of supplication. The
normal form of these is as follows,</p>

<p class="center"><i>The great Ectenia, called also the Ectenia of peace.</i></p>

<p>In peace let us pray to the Lord. <i>Response.</i>
Lord, have mercy, <i>and so after the succeeding
rogations</i>. For the peace that is from above,
and for the salvation of our souls, let us pray to
the Lord. For the peace of the whole world,<span class="pagenum"><a id="intro_Page_xvi"></a>[xvi]</span>
the good estate of the holy churches of God,
and for the union of them all, let us pray to the
Lord. For this holy temple, and for them that
with faith, piety, and fear of God enter into it,
let us pray to the Lord. For the most holy
Governing Synod, and for our Metropolitan,
<i>name</i>, for our Archbishop, or Bishop, <i>name</i>,
<i>according to the eparchy</i>, for the honourable
presbytery, the diaconate in Christ, and for all
the clergy and the laity, let us pray to the Lord.
<i>Here follow rogations for the Emperor and the
Imperial Family, mentioning them by name.</i> To
aid them and to subdue under their feet every
enemy and adversary, let us pray to the Lord.
For this city (<i>if it is monastery</i>, For this holy
habitation), for every city and country, and for
them that in faith dwell therein, let us pray to
the Lord. For healthiness of weather, for
plentifulness of the fruits of the earth, and for
peaceful times, let us pray to the Lord. For
them that voyage, that journey, that are sick,
that are suffering, that are in bonds, and for
their salvation, let us pray to the Lord. <i>Here
are inserted additional rogations for special circumstances.</i>
For our deliverance from all affliction,
passion, and want, let us pray to the Lord.
Help us, save us, have mercy on us, and keep
us, O God, by thy grace. Commemorating our
most holy, most pure, most blessed glorious
Lady, the God-bearing Ever-virgin Mary, together
with all the Saints, let us commend ourselves,<span class="pagenum"><a id="intro_Page_xvii"></a>[xvii]</span>
and one another, and all our life to
Christ our God. <i>Response.</i> To thee, O Lord.
<i>Exclamation by the priest.</i> For to thee is due
all glory, honour, and Worship, to the Father,
and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, now
and ever, and to ages of ages. <i>Response.</i> Amen.</p>

<p class="center"><i>The little Ectenia.</i></p>

<p>Again and again in peace let us pray to the
Lord. Help us.... Commemorating....
<i>as in the great Ectenia, with a varying exclamation</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>The Ectenia of earnest prayer.</i></p>

<p>Let us all say with our whole soul, and with
our whole mind let us say, <i>Response</i>. Lord,
have mercy. O Lord almighty, O God of our
fathers, we pray thee, hear, and have mercy.
<i>Response.</i> Lord, have mercy. Have mercy
upon us, O God, according to thy great mercy,
we pray thee, hear, and have mercy. <i>Response.</i>
Lord, have mercy, <i>three times; and so after the
succeeding rogations, the next being for the Emperor
and the Imperial Family, mentioning them by name.
Then the Synod, the Metropolitan, and all sorts
and conditions of men, and those especially for
whom the occasion serves are mentioned, and the
Ectenia is concluded by the priest with the exclamation</i>,
For thou art a merciful and man-loving
God, and to thee we ascribe glory, to the Father,
and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, now
and ever, and to ages of ages. <i>Response.</i>
Amen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="intro_Page_xviii"></a>[xviii]</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>The Ectenia of supplication.</i></p>

<p>Let us fulfil our supplication to the Lord.
<i>Response.</i> Lord, have mercy. Help us, save
us, have mercy on us, and keep us, O God, by
thy grace. <i>Response.</i> Lord, have mercy. That
the whole day may be perfect, holy, peaceful,
and sinless, let us ask of the Lord. <i>Response.</i>
Vouchsafe, O Lord, <i>and so successively</i>. An
angel of peace, a faithful guide, a guardian of
our souls and bodies, let us ask of the Lord.
Pardon and forgiveness of our sins and iniquities,
let us ask of the Lord. What is good and
profitable for our souls, and peace for the
world, let us ask of the Lord. That the
remaining time of our life may be accomplished
in peace and repentance, let us ask
of the Lord. A christian end of our life, painless,
unashamed, peaceful, and a good answer
at the fearful judgment-seat of Christ, let us
ask. Commemorating.... <i>as before written,
with an exclamation, or</i>, Having prayed....

<p><i>Exapostilarion.</i> A verse said or sung before
the psalms of praise (Psalms cxlviii, cxlix, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="intro_Page_xix"></a>[xix]</span>
cl). Some derive the term from the verse being
sung by one of the clergy who is sent out of his
place in the choir into the middle of the church
to sing it; but others from it being a verse
substituting a more ancient series of verses
(Lucerns), in which the Lord is prayed to send
forth light unto us.</p>

<p><i>Hypacoë.</i> A term implying that the verse
bearing its name should be listened to with
particular attention.</p>

<p><i>Icos.</i> A stanza. See Canon.</p>

<p><i>Phelonion.</i> A vestment or cope.</p>

<p><i>Prokimenon.</i> A verse, taken from the psalms,
sung before the reading of an appointed epistle.
With this is conjoined another verse, and the
mode of saying and singing these is as follows.
The reader says the prokimenon, and the choir
repeats the same. Then the reader says the
conjoined verse, and the choir again sings the
prokimenon. Finally the reader says half the
prokimenon, and the choir sings the remaining
half.</p>

<p><i>Sloujébnik.</i> The service book containing the<span class="pagenum"><a id="intro_Page_xx"></a>[xx]</span>
prayers said by the priest and deacon at Vespers,

<p>These written at length are as follows, the
first five being of frequent occurrence,</p>

<p>I and II. The priest’s initial blessing,
Blessed be our God, always, now and ever, and
to ages of ages. <i>Response.</i> Amen. And,
Blessed be the kingdom of the Father, and
of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, now and
ever, and to ages of ages. <i>Response.</i> Amen.</p>

<p>III. Holy God, holy mighty one, holy
immortal one, have mercy upon us, <i>three times</i>.
Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to
the Holy Ghost, both now and ever, and to
ages of ages. Amen. O most holy Trinity,
have mercy upon us: O Lord, cleanse our sins:
O Master, forgive our transgressions: visit us.<span class="pagenum"><a id="intro_Page_xxiv"></a>[xxiv]</span>
O Holy One, and heal our infirmities, for thy
name’s sake. Lord, have mercy, <i>three times</i>.
<i>Again</i>, Glory to the Father ... ages of ages.
Amen. <i>The Lord’s prayer, ending</i>, deliver us
from evil. <i>Priest.</i> For thine is the kingdom,
and the power, and the glory, of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, now
and ever, and to ages of ages. <i>Response.</i>
Amen.</p>

<p>IV. Glory to the Father, and to the Son,
and to the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>Both now and ever, and to ages of ages.
Amen.</p>

<p>V. The more honourable than the cherubim,
and incomparably more glorious than the seraphim,
who didst bear without corruption God
the Word, thee, verily the God-bearing one,
we magnify.</p>

<p>VI. <i>Nunc Dimittis.</i></p>

<p>VII. O come, let us worship God our King.</p>

<p>O come, let us worship, and fall down before
Christ God, our King.</p>

<p>O come, let us worship, and fall down before
Christ himself, our King and God.</p>

<p>VIII. It is very meet to bless thee, the God-bearing
one, the ever blessed, the entirely spotless,
and the Mother of our God. The more
honourable than the cherubim, and incomparably
more glorious than the seraphim, who
didst bear without corruption God the Word,
thee, verily the God-bearing one, we magnify.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="intro_Page_xxv"></a>[xxv]</span></p>

<p>IX. Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, glory to thee,
our God. <i>Three times.</i></p>

<p>X. Psalm 50.</p>

<p>XI. See Trisagion. <a href="#NOTE_I">Note i.</a></p>

<p>XII. Having seen the resurrection of Christ,
we adore the holy Lord Jesus, who alone is
without sin. Thy cross, O Christ, we worship,
and sing and glorify thy holy resurrection; for
thou art our God, we know none other beside
thee, we call upon thy name. O come, all ye
faithful, let us adore Christ’s holy resurrection;
for by the cross great joy is come into all the
world. Ever blessing the Lord, we sing his
resurrection; for, enduring crucifixion, death
by death he overthrew.</p>

<p>XIII. Blessed art thou, O Lord: O teach
me thy statutes.</p>

<p>The angelic counsel was amaz’d, seeing thee
number’d with the dead, thee, Saviour, who
hast overthrown the might of death, hast raised
Adam with thyself, and freed all from hades.</p>

<p>Blessed art thou, O Lord....</p>

<p>Why, O disciples, do ye mix the myrrh with
pitying tears? exclaim’d the angel standing
nigh the grave to them that bore the myrrh.
See ye the grave, and understand; for risen
from the grave the Saviour is.</p>

<p>Blessed art thou, O Lord....</p>

<p>They that bore myrrh made haste at early
morn lamenting to thy grave, but an angel stood<span class="pagenum"><a id="intro_Page_xxvi"></a>[xxvi]</span>
before them, and he said, The time for lamentation
is gone by, weep not, but tell the resurrection
the apostles.</p>

<p>Blessed art thou, O Lord....</p>

<p>The ointment-bearing women as they came
with myrrh unto thy grave, O Saviour, wail’d;
but an angel spake with them, and said, Why
reckon ye the living with the dead? for he is
risen from the grave as God.</p>

<p>Glory to the Father....</p>

<p>Let us adore the Father, and his Son, also
the Holy Ghost, the Holy Trinity in substance
one, exclaiming with the seraphim, Thou holy,
holy, holy art, O Lord.</p>

<p>Both now and ever....</p>

<p>Thou, Virgin, who didst bear the Giver of
life, hast Adam ransomed from sin, and Eve
hast given joy instead of grief; for he that was
made flesh of thee, the God and man, hath
them that fell from life restored thereunto.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>XIV. Glory to God in the highest, and on
earth peace, goodwill to men. We hymn thee,
we bless thee, we worship thee, we glorify thee,
we give thanks to thee for thy great glory, O
Lord, the heavenly King, O God, the Father
almighty, O Lord, the only-begotten Son, Jesus
Christ, and O Holy Ghost. O Lord God, O<span class="pagenum"><a id="intro_Page_xxvii"></a>[xxvii]</span>
Lamb of God, O Son of the Father, thou that
takest away the sins of the world, have mercy
upon us; thou that takest away the sins of the
world, accept our prayer. Thou that sittest on
the right hand of the Father, have mercy upon
us. For thou alone art holy, thou alone art
Lord, O Jesus Christ, to the glory of God the
Father. Amen. Every day will I bless thee,
and I will praise thy name to ages, and to ages
of ages. Lord, thou hast been our refuge in
generation and generation. I have said, O
Lord, have mercy upon me, heal my soul, for I
have sinned against thee. Lord, I have fled
unto thee, teach me to do thy will, for thou art
my God; for with thee is the fountain of life,
in thy light shall we see light: O continue
forth thy mercy to them that know thee.</p>

<p>Vouchsafe, O Lord, to keep us this day without
sin. Blessed art thou, O Lord, O God of
our fathers, and praised and glorified is thy
name to ages. Amen. O Lord, may thy mercy
be upon us, like as we have put our trust in thee.
Blessed art thou, O Lord, O teach me by thy
statutes. Blessed art thou, O Master, give me
understanding by thy statutes. Blessed art thou,
O Holy One, enlighten me in thy statutes. O
Lord, thy mercy endureth for ever, despise not
the work of thy hand. To thee is due praise, to
thee is due a song, to thee is due glory, to the
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost,<span class="pagenum"><a id="intro_Page_xxviii"></a>[xxviii]</span>
now and ever, and to ages of ages. Amen.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>XV. It is a good thing to give thanks unto
the Lord, and to sing unto thy name, O Most
High, to proclaim thy mercy in the morning,
and thy truth every night.</p>

<p>XVI. <i>The irmi of the great canon.</i></p>

<p>1. A help and protection hath he become
unto me unto salvation, he is my God, and I
will glorify him, my father’s God, and I will
exalt him; for he is glorified in glorious wise.</p>

<p>2. Give ear, O heaven, and I will speak, and
I will sing Christ who hath come in flesh from
the Virgin.</p>

<p>See ye, see ye, that I am God, who of old
rained manna, and caused water to spring from
the rock in the wilderness for my people, by my
sole right hand and by my strength.</p>

<p>3. On thy commandments’ unmov’d rock,
stablish thy church, O Christ.</p>

<p>Stablish my fainting heart, O Lord, on thy
commandments’ rock; for thou alone art holy
and the Lord.</p>

<p>4. The prophet heard of thine approach, O
Lord, and fear’d; for thou didst purpose of the
Virgin to be born, and to appear ’mongst men;<span class="pagenum"><a id="intro_Page_xxix"></a>[xxix]</span>
and he exclaim’d, I heard the report of thee,
and feared: glory to thy power, O Lord.</p>

<p>5. Rising from the night betimes, O lover
of mankind, I pray, Enlighten me, and lead me
in thine ordinances, and teach me, Saviour, to
perform thy will.</p>

<p>6. I cried with my whole heart to the
merciful God, and he heard me from the lowest
hades, and brought back my life from corruption.</p>

<p>7. We have sinned, we have transgressed,
we have been unrighteous before thee, we have
neither loved nor wrought that which thou hast
commanded us; still, cast us not away at the
last, O God of our fathers.</p>

<p>8. Him that heaven’s hosts glorify, and at
whose presence quake the cherubim and seraphim,
let every spirit and creature sing, bless,
and set up for evermore.</p>

<p>9. From conception seedless unspeakable’s
the birth, of Mother husbandless corruptless is
the fruit; for God’s nativity hath nature form’d
anew. Then we, all generations, right-believingly
thee magnify as Mother who was
divinely wed.</p>

<p>XVII. Thou who man-lovingly in depth of
wisdom orderest all, and unto all dost grant
that which of service is, O Maker sole; rest
thou thy servants’ souls, O Lord, for they have
plac’d their trust in thee,</p>

<p>Our Maker, and our Author, and our God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="intro_Page_xxx"></a>[xxx]</span></p>

<p>We have thee as a fortress and a haven, and
am accepted mediatress with God, whom thou
didst bear, God-bearing one unwed, salvation
thou of them that faithful be.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>XVIII. God is the Lord, and hath manifested
himself unto us: blessed is he that
cometh in the name of the Lord.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>XIX. Hear us, O God our Saviour, thou
hope of all the ends of the earth, and of them
that are far away upon the sea; and be merciful,
be merciful, O Master, concerning our sins,
and have mercy upon us. For a merciful and
man-loving God thou art, and to thee we ascribe
glory, to the Father, and to the Son, and
to the Holy Ghost, now and ever, and to ages
of ages.</p>

<p>XX. Blessed be the name of the Lord, from
henceforth, and to all ages.</p>

<p>XXI. Forgive, remit, concede, O God, our
sins, voluntary and involuntary, those in word
and in deed, those in knowledge and in ignorance,
those in the day and in the night, those in
thought and in intention; concede them all to us,<span class="pagenum"><a id="intro_Page_xxxi"></a>[xxxi]</span>
as being good and lover of mankind.</p>

<p>XXII. And may the mercies of the great
God and of our Saviour Jesus Christ be with all
of you.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

and unto heaven from earth Christ God hath
led us forth, us, singing victory’s song.</p>

<p>Preventing the dawn, and finding the stone
rolled away from the grave, they that accompanied
Mary from an angel heard, Why seek
ye as a man among the dead him that in light
accessless dwells? Behold the swathes of
death! Hasten, and tell the world the Lord
is risen, who slayeth death; for he is Son of
God, who saves the race of men.</p>

comes forth, and, with the festal-loving ranks,
let us together keep the saving Pasch of God.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Ode vi.</i></p>

<p><i>Irmos.</i> Thou didst descend into earth’s
lowest parts, O Christ, and break the eternal
bonds that held the captives bound, and the

Jonas from the whale.</p>

<p><i>Troparion.</i> Keeping the seals entire, thou

at thy birth, didst not destroy the virgin bars;

<p>If into the grave thou didst descend, Immortal
One, yet didst thou overthrow the might of

giving peace to thine apostles, O thou that
grantest resurrection unto them that fallen be.</p>

<p>The Sun, that was before the sun, set once
within a grave, the maidens bearing myrrh,

one another cried, Come ye, O friends, let us
with scents anoint the body that life-bringing
is, and buried is, the flesh, that raiseth fallen
Adam, that lieth in a grave. Let us go on, let
us make haste, like as the Magi did; and let us
bring the myrrh as gift to him that’s wrapp’d,
not in the swaddling bands, but in a winding-sheet;
and let us weep, and let us cry, Master,
arise, who grantest resurrection unto them that
fallen be.</p>

wise sped back to thee with myrrh; and him

the overthrow of hades, the first-fruits of another
life that endless is, and sing exultingly the
Cause, even him, our fathers’ God, who only
blessed and most glorious is.</p>

<p><i>Troparion.</i> How truly sacred and all-festal

which heraldeth the rising of the splendour-bearing
day, on which the ageless Light in
flesh hath shin’d to all from out the grave.</p>

and from the north, from the sea and from the
east, in thee blessing Christ for aye.</p>

our God.</p>

<p><i>Troparion.</i> Almighty Father, Word, and Spirit,
nature conjoin’d in persons three, superessential,<span class="pagenum"><a id="intro_Page_xxxvii"></a>[xxxvii]</span>
God most high, in thee baptized we have been,

<p><i>Irmos.</i> Shine, shine, O new Jerusalem; for
the glory of the Lord is risen on thee. Exult
now, and rejoice, O Sion; and thou, O pure
God-bearing one, be glad at the rising of thy
Child.</p>

<p><i>Verse.</i> My soul him magnifies, who willingly
did suffer and was buried, and rose the third
day from the grave, even Christ, the Giver of
life.</p>

<p><i>Troparion.</i> O voice of thee divine, most
sweet, and dear! for thou hast promis’d undeceivingly
to be with us, O Christ, until the
ages end, which holding as hope’s stablishment,
let us, the faithful, joyful be.</p>

<p><i>Verse.</i> Christ is the Pascha new, the living
sacrifice, the Lamb of God, who the world’s
sins doth take away.</p>

<p><i>Troparion.</i> O Christ, thou great most sacred
Pasch, wisdom, and Word of God, and power!

<p>To-day the sacred Pascha is made manifest
to us, the new, the holy Pasch, the Pascha
mystical, the Pascha all-rever’d, the Pascha,
even Christ the ransomer, the Pascha undefil’d,
the Pascha great, the faithful’s Pasch, the Pasch
that opes the gates of Paradise to us, the Pasch
that halloweth all that faithful be.</p>

<p><i>Verse.</i> As smoke is driven away....</p>

<p>Come from that spectacle, ye women-gospellers,
and unto Sion say, Receive from us the
joyful tidings of Christ’s resurrection. Be
fervent, dance, and joy, Jerusalem, beholding
Christ the King proceed as bridegroom from
the grave.</p>

<p><i>Verse.</i> So let the sinners perish....</p>

<p>The women bearing myrrh at early dawn
stood the Life-giver’s grave before, and found
an angel sitting on the stone, and he, accosting
them, spake thus, Why seek the living mid the
dead? why the corruptless wail as though he in
corruption were? Go, tell ye his disciples this!</p>

<p><i>Verse.</i> This is the day which....</p>

<p>Pascha the fervent, Pascha, the Pascha of the
Lord, the Pascha all-rever’d hath risen on us.
It Pascha is, let us with joy each other greet.
O Pascha, ransoming from grief! For, shining
from the grave to-day, as bridegroom from a
bridal-room, Christ hath with joy the women
fill’d, saying, Tell the disciples this!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Glory. Both now.</i></p>

<p>It is the day of resurrection, and by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="intro_Page_xxxix"></a>[xxxix]</span>
triumph be illuminate we, and we each other
greet, and Brethren! to them that hate us say,
and at the resurrection everything forgive; and

<p>Christ is risen from the dead, death by death
down doth he tread, and on them that dwell in
graves he bestoweth life. <i>Three times.</i></p>

<p>A. Note that in Appendix the word translated
<i>Archpriest</i> is in the original <i>Archiereus</i>,
and signifies the Bishop. There is however
another word which can only be translated
into English by the term <i>Archpriest</i>, namely
<i>Protoiereus</i>, but this is a title borne by many
priests who are not of episcopal rank.</p>

<p>B. And note that in the Psalms the
Orthodox Church follows the Septuagint and
not the Hebrew enumeration.</p>

according to the scriptures; And ascended into
the heavens, and sitteth at the right hand of the
Father; And shall come again with glory to
judge both the quick and the dead, of whose
kingdom there shall be no end. And in the
Holy Ghost, the Lord, the giver of life, who
proceedeth from the Father, who with the
Father and the Son is together worshipped
and glorified, who spake by the prophets. In
one, holy, catholic, and apostolic church. I
acknowledge one baptism for the remission of
sins. I look for the resurrection of the dead;
And the life in the ages to come. Amen.</p>

<p class="dropcap">For thou by thy will hast from nothingness
brought all things into being, and by thy
power thou sustainest creation, and by thy
foreknowledge, directest the world. Thou from
four elements hast formed creation, and hast
crowned the circle of the year with four seasons.
All the spiritual powers tremble before thee,
the sun praiseth thee, the moon glorifieth thee,
the stars make intercession with thee, the light
hearkeneth unto thee, the depths shudder at
thy presence, the springs of water serve thee.
Thou hast stretched out the heaven as a curtain,
thou hast founded the earth upon the
waters, thou hast bounded the sea with sand,
thou hast diffused the air for breathing. The
angelic powers minister unto thee, the choirs of
archangels worship thee, the many-eyed cherubim
and the six-winged seraphim, standing and
flying around, cover themselves with fear of
thine unapproachable glory. For thou, being the
uninscribable, unbeginning, and unspeakable
God, didst come down upon earth, taking the
form of a servant, being made in the likeness of
men; for thou, O Master, through the tenderness
of thy mercy, didst not endure to behold
the race of men tormented by the devil, but
thou didst come and save us. We confess thy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
grace, we proclaim thy mercy, we conceal not
thy beneficence. Thou hast set at liberty the
generations of our nature, thou didst hallow the
virginal womb by thy birth. All creation praiseth
thee who didst manifest thyself; for thou, O
our God, wast seen upon earth, and didst dwell
together with men. Thou didst hallow the
streams of Jordan, sending down from heaven
thy Holy Ghost, and didst crush the heads of
the dragons that lurked therein.</p>

<p>Do thou thyself therefore, O man-loving
King, be present now also through the descent
of thy Holy Ghost, and sanctify this water.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Thrice.</i></p>

<p>And give it the grace of redemption, the
blessing of Jordan. Make it a fountain of
incorruption, a gift of sanctification, a loosing
of sins, a healing of sicknesses, a destruction of
demons, unapproachable by hostile powers, fulfilled
with angelic strength, and let them that
take counsel together against thy creature flee
therefrom; for I have called upon thy name,
O Lord, which is wonderful, and glorious, and
terrible to adversaries.</p>

<p><i>And he signeth the water thrice, dipping his
fingers therein, and, breathing upon it, saith,</i></p>

<p>Let all the hostile powers be crushed beneath
the sign of the image of thy cross.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Thrice.</i></p>

<p>We pray thee, O Lord, let every airy and
invisible spectre withdraw itself from us, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
let not a demon of darkness conceal himself in
this water, neither let an evil spirit, bringing
obscurity of purpose and rebellious thoughts,
descend thereinto with him that is to be baptized.
But thou, O Master of all, declare this water
water of redemption, water of sanctification, a
cleansing of flesh and spirit, a loosing of bonds,
a forgiveness of iniquities, an illumination of
soul, a bath of regeneration, a renewal of the
spirit, a gift of sonship, a garment of incorruption,
a fountain of life. For thou hast said, O
Lord, Wash you, and be ye clean, put away evil
from your souls. Thou hast bestowed upon us
regeneration from on high by water and the
spirit. Manifest thyself, O Lord, in this water,
and grant that he that is to be baptized may be
transformed therein to the putting away of the
old man, which is corrupt according to the
deceitful lusts, and to the putting on of the new,
which is renewed according to the image of him
that created him, that, being planted in the
likeness of thy death through baptism, he may
become a sharer of resurrection; and, preserving
the gift of thy Holy Ghost, and increasing
the deposit of grace, he may attain unto the
prize of his high calling, and be counted among
the number of the first-born, whose names are
written in heaven, to thee our God and Lord,
Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might, together

<p class="dropcap">It is the duty of him that is the recipient of
human thoughts to be a pattern of all good
things, and to be continent, humble, and
virtuous, praying himself every hour unto God,
that he may give him the word of wisdom to
correct them that betake themselves to him.
First of all it is his duty himself to fast wednesday
and friday throughout the year, as the
divine canons direct, since from these he hath
to direct himself and others what to do. But
if he himself be ignorant, incontinent, and
pleasure-loving, how can he teach virtue unto
others? and who would be so unwise as to
hearken unto him concerning that which he
hath to say, seeing him a disorderly person and
a drunkard, and teaching others not to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
intemperate, or to follow any virtue whatever,
while he himself is unable to do this? For eyes
are more believing than ears, saith the divine
scripture. Therefore, take heed unto thyself,
O thou that art a spiritual person; for if one
sheep be lost through thy negligence, it shall
be required at thy hands. For cursed, saith the
scripture, is he that doeth the work of the Lord
negligently. And the great Basil saith, Give
heed, that thou fear not a man in his fall, that
thou give not the Son of God into unworthy
hands, that thou be not ashamed of him because
of them that are glorious on the earth,
and that thou communicate not even him that
weareth a diadem. For the divine canons do
not permit the unworthy to be communicated,
since they are regarded as heathen. If they
will not repent, woe unto them, and to them
that communicate them. Give heed, he saith,
thou seest I will not permit such things. These
and the like precepts keeping, and before all
things, preserving the ecclesiastical dogmas
immoveably, thou shalt save thyself, and them
that hearken unto thee. If any without proper
licence from the local Bishop dare to be the
recipient of thoughts and to confess, such shall
rightly receive punishment as a transgressor of
the divine canons; for he doth not only ruin
himself, but as many as are confessed by him,
they are not confessed, and as many as are
bound or loosed, they are not corrected, according<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>

in thy wonted love to man, accept this thy
servant, <i>name</i>, who lamenteth because of those
iniquities which he hath wrought, overlooking
all that he hath done, forgiving his unrighteousness,
and passing-by his transgressions. For
thou, O Lord, hast said that pleasure thou hast
not in the death of a sinner, but rather that he
should return and live; and that sins shall be
forgiven until seventy times seven. For as thy
greatness is incomparable, so is thy mercy
immeasurable. For if thou shouldest mark

away the sins of the world, who didst give
remittance unto the two debtors, and grant
pardon of her sins unto the harlot; do thou thyself,
O Master, concede, forgive, and pardon
the sins, transgressions, and the voluntary and
involuntary offences, which, in knowledge and
in ignorance, thy servants have wrought, and
whatsoever they have done, as men bearing
flesh and living in the world, being beguiled by
the devil. If by word, or by deed, or in knowledge,
or in ignorance they have sinned, or
have despised the word of a priest, or are under
the malediction of a priest, or are fallen under
their own anathema, or are bound under an
oath; do thou thyself, as the good Master, who
requitest not evil, be pleased that these, thy
servants, be loosed by the word, forgiving them
their own anathema and oath, according to the
greatness of thy mercy. Yea, O Master, thou
man-loving Lord, hearken unto us beseeching
thy grace for these thy servants; and, as the
most merciful one, overlook all their offences,
and deliver them from everlasting torment.
For thou, O Master, hast said, Whatsoever ye<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven,
and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be
loosed in heaven. For thou alone art without

not to tell me all that thou hast done, so that
thou mayest receive forgiveness from our Lord
Jesus Christ. Behold, his image is before us,
and I am only the witness, that I may bear
witness before him of all thou tellest me. If

thou make a good beginning. And, above all

unto men; for this becometh not christians:
but live honourably, and righteously, and
devoutly, and may God assist thee by his grace.</p>

as thou didst remember thy holy forty martyrs,
sending down upon them crowns from heaven.
Remember, O God, the parents who have

the foundation of houses. Remember, O Lord
our God, thy servants, the paranymphs, who are
present at this rejoicing. Remember, O Lord
our God, thy servant, <i>name</i>, and thine handmaid,

seed of corn, that, having every sufficiency, they
may abound in every work that is good and

and liftest up the beggar from the dunghill,
O Father of the orphans, and haven of the tempest-tost,
and physician of them that are sick;
who painlessly bearest our weaknesses, and
takest away our sicknesses; who shewest mercy
with gentleness, overlookest transgressions, and
takest away unrighteousness; who art quick to
help and slow to anger; who didst breathe upon
thy disciples, and say, Receive ye the Holy
Ghost, whosoever sins ye remit, they are remitted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
unto them; who acceptest the repentance
of sinners, and hast power to forgive many and
grievous sins, and vouchsafest healing unto all
that continue in weakness and protracted sickness;
who me also, thine humble, sinful, and
unworthy servant, involved in many sins, and
overwhelmed with lusts of pleasures, hast called
to the holy and exceeding great degree of the
priesthood, and to enter in within the veil into
the holy of holies, where the holy Angels desire
to stoop to look, and hear the evangelical voice
of the Lord God, and behold as eye-witnesses
the presence of the holy oblation, and be enraptured
with the divine and sacred liturgy;
who hast counted me worthy to minister the
sacred rite of thy most heavenly mystery, and to
offer unto thee gifts and sacrifices for our sins,
and for the ignorances of the people, and to
mediate for thy rational flock, that, through
thy great and unspeakable love to man, thou
mayest cleanse their iniquities; do thou thyself,
O most good King, attend unto my prayer at
this hour, and on this holy day, and in every
time and place, and accept the voice of my
prayer, and grant healing unto thy servant, <i>name</i>,
who is in weakness of soul and body, vouchsafing
unto him remission of sins and forgiveness
of voluntary and involuntary iniquities: heal
his incurable wounds, and every sickness and
every sore, bestowing upon him spiritual healing.
It was thou who didst touch the mother-in-law<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
of Peter, and the fever left her, and she
arose and ministered unto thee: do thou thyself,
O Master, bestow a remedy upon thy
servant, <i>name</i>, and an alleviation of every
mortal pain, and remember thine abundant
compassions, and thy mercy. Remember that
the intention of man inclineth constantly toward
evil from his youth up, and that none is
to be found sinless upon earth; for thou alone
art without sin, who didst come and save the
race of men, and deliver us from the servitude
of the enemy. For if thou shouldest enter into
judgment with thy servants, there is none that
would be found pure from defilement, but every
mouth would be shut, not having wherewith to
answer; for all our righteousness is as filthy
rags before thee. For this cause remember
not, Lord, the sins of our youth; for thou art
the hope of the hopeless, and the rest of them
that are weary and heavy-laden with transgressions,
and to thee we ascribe glory, with
thine unbeginning Father, and with thy most
holy, and good, and life-creating Spirit, now

<p class="dropcap">We give thanks unto thee, O Lord our God,
thou good lover of mankind, and physician
of our souls and bodies, who painlessly
bearest our sicknesses, and by whose stripes
we have all been healed; thou good shepherd,
who camest to seek the wandering sheep; who
givest consolation unto the faint-hearted, and
life unto them that are broken down; who
didst heal the source of the issue of blood that
had lasted twelve years; who didst deliver the
daughter of the Chananitish woman from the
ruthless demon; who didst forgive the debt unto
the two debtors, and give remission unto the
sinful woman; who didst bestow healing upon
the paralytic, with the remission of his sins;
who didst justify the publican by a word, and
didst accept the thief in his last confession;
who takest away the sins of the world, and
wast nailed on the cross; to thee we pray, and
thee we beseech, Do thou thyself, O God, in
thy goodness, loosen, forgive, and pardon the
transgressions and sins of thy servant, <i>name</i>,
and his voluntary and involuntary iniquities,
those in knowledge and in ignorance, those by
trespass and disobedience, those by night and
by day; or if he be under the curse of a priest,
or of a father or a mother; or if by the glance
of the eye, or a movement of the eyelid; or
by the contact of adultery, or the tasting of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
prodigality, or in any excitement of flesh and
spirit he have estranged himself from thy will,
and from thy holiness. And if he have sinned,
and in like manner we also, as the good God
that rememberest not evil and the lover of mankind,
do thou pardon, not leaving him and us
to fall into a dissolute life, neither to walk in
ways of destruction. Yea, O Master Lord, hear
me, a sinner, at this hour on behalf of thy
servant, <i>name</i>, and overlook, as the God that
rememberest not evil, all his iniquities; deliver
him from eternal torment; fill his mouth with
thy praise; open his lips to the glorification of
thy name; extend his hands to the doing of
thy commandments; direct his feet in the path
of thy gospel, confirming all his members and
his intention by thy grace. For thou art our
God, who, by thy holy apostles, hast commanded
us, saying, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth,
shall be bound in the heavens, and whatsoever
ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in the
heavens; and again, Unto whomsoever ye remit
sins, they are remitted unto them, and, If ye
bind them, they are bound. And, as thou didst
hearken unto Ezekias in the affliction of his
soul in the hour of his death, and didst not
despise his prayer, so hearken unto me, thine
humble, and sinful, and unworthy servant at
this hour. For thou, O Lord Jesus Christ, art
he that, in thy goodness and love to man,
biddeth to forgive until seventy times seven<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
them that fall into sins; and thou repentest
thee concerning our evils, and rejoicest over the
return of the wanderer. For, as is thy greatness,
so also is thy mercy, and to thee we ascribe
glory, with thine unbeginning Father, and with
thy most holy, and good, and life-creating
Spirit, now and ever, and to ages of ages.

<p class="dropcap">O Master, Lord our God, physician of
souls and bodies, who restorest from long-continued
sufferings, healest every sickness
and every wound among the people, willest that
all men should be saved and come to a knowledge
of the truth, and desirest not the death of
a sinner, but that he should return and live.
For, thou, Lord, in the old testament didst
appoint repentance unto sinners, to David, and
to the Ninevites, and to them that were before
these; but during the course of thine incarnate
dispensation, didst not call the righteous but
sinners to repentance, even accepting the
publican, the harlot, the thief, and the blaspheming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
persecutor, the great Paul, through
repentance. Thou, through repentance, didst
accept Peter, the leader and thine apostle, who
denied thee thrice, and didst make promise
unto him, saying, Thou art Peter, and upon this
rock will I build my church, and the gates of
hades shall not prevail against it, and I will
give to thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.
Wherefore we also, O good one and the lover
of mankind, being bold according to thine
undeceiving promises, pray unto thee, and supplicate
at this hour. Hearken unto our prayer
and accept it as incense offered unto thee, and
visit thy servant, <i>name</i>, and if he have sinned
by word, or deed, or intention, or in the night,
or in the day, if he be under the curse of a
priest, or be fallen under his own curse, or be
embittered by a curse, and have forsworn himself,
we supplicate thee, and to thee we pray,
Pardon, forgive, and loosen him, O God, overlooking
his transgressions, and the sins which
in knowledge and in ignorance have been done
by him. And in whatsoever he have transgressed
thy commandments, or have sinned,
because he beareth flesh and liveth in the
world, or because of the operation of the devil,
do thou thyself, as the good and man-loving
God, loosen him; for there is no man that liveth
and sinneth not: thou only art without sin, thy
righteousness is an everlasting righteousness,
and thy word is the truth. For thou didst not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
form man for destruction, but for the keeping
of thy commandments, and for the inheritance
of life incorruptible, and to thee we ascribe
glory, with the Father, and with the Holy Ghost,

<p>What sweet of life abideth unaccompanied

unchang’d? All is the feeblest shade, all the

<p class="center"><i>Tone ii.</i></p>

<p>Woe unto me, what agony hath the soul when
it is from the body torn! alas, then how it
weeps, and none is merciful to it! To Angels
lifting eyes, without effect it prays; to men
extending hands, it findeth none to help.
Therefore, my brethren lov’d, musing on our
brief life, let us for the departed ask for rest
from Christ, and for great mercy for our souls.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Tone iii.</i></p>

<p>All human things are vanity which last not
after death: riches abide not, nor doth glory
stay; for when death cometh, these all disappear.
Then let us cry to the immortal Christ, O rest
him who is gone away from us where is the
dwelling-place of all that joy.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Tone iv.</i></p>

<p>Where is the predilection of the world? where
their imaginings who fade? where is the silver
and the gold? where servants’ multitude and
noise? All dust, all ashes, all a shade. But,
come ye, let us say to the immortal King, O
Lord, him, who hath been remov’d from us, of
thine eternal blessings worthy count, him resting
in thine ageless happiness.</p>

<p>I remember’d what the prophet said, I am
earth, and I am dust; and again I meditated in
the graves, and saw the naked bones, and said,
Who now is king, or warrior who, or who is
rich, or who is poor, or who the just, or he that
sinn’d? But, with the just, thy servant rest, O
Lord.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Tone vi.</i></p>

<p>To me thy life-effecting bidding was substance
and origin; for, willing me to form a
living one from nature that unseen is and is
seen, my body thou didst make of earth, and,
by thy breathing life-creating and divine, me
gavest soul. Therefore, O Christ, thy servant
rest in tract of them that living are, and in the
dwellings of the just.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Tone vii.</i></p>

<p>After thine image and resemblance in the

didst place to be of thy creation lord; but, by
the devil’s enviousness beguil’d, he ate the fruit,
transgressing thy commands. Therefore, again
to earth, whence he was taken, thou hast doom’d
him to return, O Lord, and beg for rest.</p>

<p>I weep and I lament when I reflect on death,

form. O wonder! what is this mystery concerning
us? how to corruption have we been

<p>Come, brethren, let us give the last kiss to
the dead, and render thanks to God; for he
hath left his kinsfolk, and hasteneth to the
grave: to him there is no care concerning
vanities and carnal toil. Where now are kinsfolk
and where friends? Lo, we are parted
from him, whom, Lord, we pray thee to give
rest.</p>

<p>What, O ye brethren, is this parting? what
this weeping? what this wailing in the present
hour? Come, kiss ye then him whom but lately
was with us; for he is given to the grave, is
cover’d with a stone, in darkness dwelleth, is
buried with the dead, and now is parted from
all kinsfolk and from friends; and him, O
Lord, we pray thee to give rest.</p>

<p>Now is life’s evil boast of vanity destroy’d;
for from its dwelling-place the soul is gone,
the clay is ashen, the casket broken, it voiceless
is, no feeling hath, is dead and motionless.
And him consigning to the grave, let us beseech
the Lord to give him everlasting rest.</p>

<p>What is our life? a flower, a smoke, and,
verily, a morning dew. O come ye then, let
us, with open eyes, regard the graves. Where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
is the beauty of the body? where youth? where
eyes, and carnal form? All are consum’d as
grass, all vanish’d. Come, fall we down to
Christ in tears.</p>

<p>Great is the weeping and the wailing, great
is the sighing and the need at parting from the
soul. Hades and destruction wait; and transitory
life appears a fleeting shade, a dream of
error; and the toil of earthly life unseemly
phantasy. Far let us fly from every worldly sin,
that heaven may be our heritage.</p>

<p>Gazing on him that lieth dead, O take we all
a likeness of our final hour; for he is pass’d as
vapour from the earth, is wither’d as a flower,
as grass cut down, wrapp’d in a winding-sheet,
and hid in earth. And, leaving him unseen,
let us pray Christ to give him everlasting rest.</p>

<p>Adam’s descendants, come ye, let us see
laid low in earth a likeness of ourselves, which
hath all beauty lost, is in the grave’s decay dissolv’d,
in darkness is by worms consum’d, and
in the earth is hid. And, leaving him unseen,
let us pray Christ to give him everlasting rest.</p>

<p>When from the body parted is the soul by
force by Angels dread, all kinsfolk and acquaintance
it forgets, and is impress’d concerning
standing at the judgment-seat to come, that
shall decide the things of vanity and carnal toil.
Then, praying to the judge, let us all beg the
Lord to pardon him what he hath done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span></p>

<p>Come, brethren, let us within the grave behold
the ashes and the dust whereof we formed
were. Where go we now? and what become?
what is the poor, or what the rich? or what the
lord, and what the free? Are not all dust? The
beauty of the countenance is gone, and death
hath wasted all the flower of youth.</p>

<p>Verily vain and perishing are all the things
of life, seeming, and gloriousless; for we all go
away, all die, kings and princes, judges and
them that mighty be, the rich and poor, and
every mortal man; for now they that aforetime
liv’d are cast into the grave, whom that the
Lord may rest we pray.</p>

<p>Now all the organs of the body idle are
beheld, which active were but late, all without
motion, without feeling, dead; for closed are
the eyes, the feet are bound, the hands are listless,
and with them the ears; the tongue is
clos’d in silence, consigned to the grave: all
human things are vanity indeed.</p>

<p>Save them that put their trust in thee, O
Mother of the Sun that setteth not, thou
Bringer-forth of God: with thine entreaties,
we beseech thee, pray the most good God to
rest him now departed hence where rest the
righteous souls; him of divine good things
declare thou heir in halls of righteous ones, unto
remembrance everlasting, thou all undefil’d.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Glory. Tone vi.</i></p>

<p>Me, lying voiceless and depriv’d of breath,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
beholding, bewail ye me, O brethren and O
friends, O kinsfolk and acquaintances; for
yesterday I spake with you, and suddenly on
me came the dread hour of death. But, come
ye, all that love me, and kiss me with the final
kiss; for never shall I go with you again, or
further converse hold with you. For I depart
unto the judge, where no respect of persons is,
where slave and lord together stand, the king
and warrior, rich and poor, in equal worthiness;
for each, according to his deeds, is glorified or
sham’d. But I beg all, and all entreat unceasingly
to pray Christ God for me, that, for
my sins, I be not bidden unto torment’s place,
but that he may appoint my lot where is the
light of life.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE ORDINANCE THAT IS OBSERVED CONCERNING THE CARRYING
FORTH OF THEM THAT FALL ASLEEP IN HOLY PASCHA, AND IN ALL THE BRIGHT WEEK.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>It behoveth to know that if any pass away on
holy pascha, or on any day whatever of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
bright week until the sunday of Thomas, somewhat
less of the customary song for them that
have fallen asleep is sung, because of the
majesty and honour of the joyful festival of
the resurrection; for it is a festival of joy and
gladness, and not of lamentation. And since
all who die in hope of resurrection and eternal
life are through the resurrection of Christ,
removed from the griefs of this world to things
that are joyful and glad, the church at the time
when Christ is risen proclaimeth this by the
resurrection song over them that have fallen
asleep; and, by somewhat less song, ectenias
and prayer for them that have fallen asleep, we
are assured that he that dieth in penitence, if
he have not yet made satisfaction concerning
his iniquities, these are remitted to him by the
prayers of the church, and that he is freed from
their bond.</p>

<p><i>The priest then having come, with his clerks, to
the house in which the body of the dead lieth, and
put on him the epitrachelion and the phelonion,
and censed the remains, beginneth as customarily,</i></p>

<p>Blessed be our God.... <i>And the clerk
singeth</i>, Christ is risen.... <i>in tone v. And
the priest saith the customary verses, that is to say,</i>
Let God arise.... <i>and all the rest</i>.</p>

<p><i>And while these are being sung, the priest
sprinkleth the body of the dead with sanctified
water, and his coffin without and within, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
straightway they lay him therein. And, the song
being ended, the deacon saith the customary ectenias
for them that have fallen asleep. And the priest
in a low voice readeth the prayer, that is to say</i>, O
God of Spirits.... <i>Vide page <a href="#Page_139">139</a>. And after

<p>For tasting the tree’s fruit of old Adam from
paradise was driven; but for thee owning to be
God, when on the cross he hung, the thief was
plac’d in paradise. And, saved by thy passion,
Lord, we imitate the thief, crying in faith,
Remember us, when in thy kingdom thou shalt
come.</p>

<p>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall
see God.</p>

<p>My maker, taking clay from earth, by will
divine my body form’d, but by a holy ordinance
he plac’d a soul therein, by breathing
breath that beareth life. And when to sin’s
corruption I in evil wise was bound, me thou
recalledst, lover of mankind, by tenderness
extreme. But rest, O God, among thy Saints,
him whom thou hast receiv’d.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Icos.</i></p>

<p>Thyself alone immortal art, who madest and
didst fashion man, for out of earth we mortals
fashion’d were, and unto that same earth shall
go, as thou who madest me hast given command,
and sayest unto me, Earth thou art, and
unto earth shalt thou return. And thither all
we mortals go, making the funeral wail, even
the song, the <i>Alleluia</i>.</p>

<p>Hearken in thoughtful wise, I pray; for I
with pain these words announce; yea, for your
sake I make the wail: it may for profit be to
some. But when ye have to sing these words,
remember me who once was known; for ofttimes
we together went, and in God’s house
together sang the <i>Alleluia</i>.</p>

<p>Arise ye then, and gather ye together all, and,
sitting down, hear ye a word, Brethren, the
judgment-seat is dread, where we have every
one to stand. There none is slave, and none<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
is free; there none is little, none is great; but
all in nakedness shall stand: for this cause it is
well to sing ofttimes the psalm, the <i>Alleluia</i>.</p>

<p>Bewail we all with tears as we behold the
relics lie, and all approaching them to kiss let
us in equal wise exclaim, Lo, thou hast left them
who thee lov’d: wilt thou not speak with us
again? Why dost thou speak not, friend, as
thou wast wont to speak to us? But so thou
silent art, even to say with us the <i>Alleluia</i>.</p>

<p>What, brethren, are the dying’s bitter words,
which, when they go, they say? I from the
brethren parted am, I quit and leave you all, O
friends. Then where I go I do not know, and
how I shall be there know not: God only knows,
who calleth me. But make ye my memorial
with the song, the <i>Alleluia</i>.</p>

<p>Then where now go the souls? then how
now fare they there? I long to learn the mystery;
but none sufficient is to tell. Do they
remember their own things, as we remember
them? or have they us forgotten who are left,
who them lament and make the song, the
<i>Alleluia</i>.</p>

<p>Accompany the dead, O friends, and to the
grave with heed hie ye, and muse ye there in
thoughtful wise, and your own feet prepare: all
youthfulness is cast therein, all vigour fadeth
there: there dust and ashes are, and worms:
there all is silence, and none saying <i>Alleluia</i>.</p>

<p>Lo, now we see him lying, but to us no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
presence is of him: behold, the tongue now
silent is, and, lo, already cease the lips. Farewell,
O friends, O children; be ye saved, O ye
brethren, O acquaintance, be ye sav’d; for I
depart my way. But make ye my memorial
with the song, the <i>Alleluia</i>.</p>

<p>Not one of those who there hath gone doth
live again to tell to us how they, our brethren
once and kinsfolk, fare who there have come
before the Lord. Therefore, we oft, yea, ever
say, Do they each other there behold? do they
a brother see? do they together say the psalm,
the <i>Alleluia</i>?</p>

<p>We go the everlasting way in mien as them
that are condemn’d, with faces all cast down.
Then where is beauty? where is wealth? then
where the glory of this life? Nothing of these
shall help us there, even to say ofttimes the
psalm, the <i>Alleluia</i>.</p>

<p>Why in untimely wise disquietest thou thyself,
O man? one hour, and all is gone; for there in
hades no repentance is, nor any further pardon
there: the never-dying worm is there, all there
is dark and gloomy land, where I must come to
be condemn’d. For I have not ofttimes made
speed to say the psalm, the <i>Alleluia</i>.</p>

<p>Nothing so soon forgotten is by man as man
when he is gone; for, if we do remember for a
time, we straightway death forget, when absent
is the dead. And parents even every child forget,
that, of the womb begot, they nourish’d<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
have, and have with tears accompanied with the
song, the <i>Alleluia</i>.</p>

<p>I remind you, O my brethren, and my children,
and my friends, that ye forget me not when ye
beseech the Lord. I pray, I ask, I make
entreaty that ye keep these words in memory,
and bewail me day and night. I speak to you
as Job did to his friends, O sit ye down to say
again the <i>Alleluia</i>.</p>

<p>Forsaking all things we depart, and naked
and abhorrent we become; for comeliness doth
fade away as grass, but only do we men delude
ourselves. Thou naked, wretched one, wast
born, and altogether naked there shalt stand!
Then be not prodigal in life, O man; but
only always sigh with wailing, <i>Alleluia</i>.</p>

<p>If thou, O man, art merciful to man, he there
shall mercy have to show to thee; and if to any
orphan hast been kind, he there shall thee
deliver out of need; if thou in life the naked
clothed hast, he there shall clothing have to put
on thee, and sing the psalm, the <i>Alleluia</i>.</p>

<p>The way is evil whereby I depart, and therein
so I never went; that country also is unknown,
where me none recognize at all. ’Tis fearful
them to see who dreadfully are led, and him
who me hath call’d, who ruleth life and death,
and there us biddeth when he willeth. <i>Alleluia.</i></p>

<p>If from some country we depart, we of some
guides have need. What shall we do, and whither
go, that country in, where we are quite unknown?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
To thee will then be needful many
guides, and many prayers to go with thee to
save thy wretched soul, ere it attain to Christ,
and say to him, the <i>Alleluia</i>.</p>

<p>They that to lusts material subject are, in nowise
have forgiveness there: there terrible accusers
are, and there too opened are the books.
Then where, O man, wilt thou glance round?
or who will there then thee assist? save thou
in life hast wrought some good, or done some
kindness to the poor, singing the <i>Alleluia</i>.</p>

<p>Both youth and bodily beauty fade away in
time of death, and then in painful wise is parch’d
the tongue, and, dried up, is scorch’d the throat,
then quenched is the beauty of the eyes, all
chang’d the beauty of the face, the beauty of
the neck is spoil’d, and what remaineth silent
is to say ofttimes the <i>Alleluia</i>.</p>

<p>Keep silence then, keep silence: O ye survivors,
be ye still before him lying there, and
contemplate the mystery great; for fearful is
the hour. Hush, that the soul may go in peace;
for it endureth anguish great, and in much fear
beseecheth God with <i>Alleluia</i>.</p>

<p>I have seen an infant dying, and for my life
have wept; for it was altogether scar’d, and,
when its hour came, trembling cried, O father,
help me; mother, save me! and none sufficient
was to help it then: they only griev’d beholding,
and in the grave bewail’d it. <i>Alleluia.</i></p>

<p>How many on a sudden have been taken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
from their bridal to the grave, betroth’d been
with an everlasting troth, have costless made
the dirge, and from the chamber have not
risen; but together there was marriage and
the grave, together troth and parting, together
laughter and the wail, yea, and the psalm, the
<i>Alleluia</i>.</p>

<p>We are enflam’d when only hearing that everlasting
light is there, there our life’s fount, and
there eternal joy: the paradise is there where
every soul rejoiceth with the just. We all in
Christ shall gather’d be, that so to God we all
may cry the <i>Alleluia</i>.</p>

<p>All-holy Virgin, thou unwedded one, who
didst bring forth th’ approachless light, I pray,
entreaty make, and beg, Cease not to pray the
Lord concerning him, thy sleeping servant,
thou most pure, that in the day of judgment he
may find forgiveness there; for thou, as Queen
all pure, to pray thy Son hast always boldness.
<i>Alleluia</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>the following stichera idiomela are said,<br>

<p>What sweet of life abideth unaccompanied
with grief? what glory stayeth upon earth unchang’d?
All is the feeblest shade, all the most
cheating dream: one moment, and death taketh
all these things. But in thy face’s light, O
Christ, and in the sweetness of thy beauty,
grant rest to him whom thou hast call’d, as
lover of mankind.</p>

<p><i>Verse.</i> The Lord tendeth me, and there is
nothing lacking to me.</p>

<p>By deed, my Saviour, thou hast shewn that
thou the resurrection art of all, who didst, O
Word, by word raise Lazarus from the dead.
Then were the fetters burst, and shatter’d hades’
gates; then human death declared was a sleep.
Thou, therefore, who didst come thy creature,
not to judge, but save, rest him whom thou
received hast, as lover of mankind.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Glory. Both now. Theotokion.</i></p>

<p>Thou art made manifest, O Bringer-forth of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
God, a fervent advocate for all, for all a shelter,
and a might of God for them that hie to thee,
an aid for them that are in need, a quick deliverance
for the bound. For thee against
barbarians Christ hath placed as a fence, and
barrier, and assailless wall; and for the weak a
strength unovercome; and for our souls the
arbitress of peace.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Stichera, tone ii.</i></p>

<p>Woe unto me, what agony hath the soul
when it is from the body torn! alas, then
how it weeps, and none is merciful to it! To
Angels lifting eyes, without effect it prays; to
men extending hands, it findeth none to help.
Therefore, my brethren lov’d, musing on our
brief life, let us for the departed ask for rest
from Christ, and for great mercy for our souls.</p>

<p><i>Verse.</i> When I was in affliction I cried unto
the Lord, and he heard me.</p>

<p>Come, let us all a wonder passing thought
behold: he who but yesterday abode with us
now lieth dead. Come, let us know that soon
in funeral swathes we also at an end shall be;
and they anointed with the fragrant myrrh shall
lie of odour ill. How is it they adorn’d with
gold lie unadorn’d and void of form? Therefore,
my brethren well belov’d, musing on our
brief life, let us of Christ entreat for rest for
him who hence hath gone, and for great mercy
for our souls.</p>

go where never have I trod. But come, remembering
my love for you, follow ye me, and give
ye to the grave this clay of mine, and pray ye
Christ with tears, who hath to judge my humble
soul, that he may snatch me from the quenchless
fire.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Glory. Both now. Theotokion.</i></p>

<p>O gate impassable, in mystery seal’d, God-bearing

thee, may save our souls.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Stichera idiomela, tone iii.</i></p>

<p>Lo, brethren mine belov’d, amid you all I
silent lie, bereft of speech; the mouth is listless,
still the tongue, impeded are the lips,
the hands are tied, the feet together bound, the
countenance is chang’d, the eyes are dimm’d
and see not them that wail, the hearing takes
not in the cry of them that mourn, the nose the
fragrant incense smelleth not; but in nowise
true love becometh dead. Therefore I you
beseech, all mine acquaintances and friends,
Remember me before the Lord, that I in day of
doom may mercy find before that fearful judgment-seat.</p>

<p><i>Verse.</i> I have lifted up mine eyes to the
hills, whence cometh my help.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span></p>

<p>All human things are vanity which last not
after death: riches abide not, nor doth glory
stay; for when death cometh these all disappear.
Then let us cry to the immortal Christ, O rest
him who is gone away from us where is the
dwelling-place of all that joy.</p>

<p><i>Verse.</i> The Lord shall keep thy goings-out
and thy comings-in from henceforth and for

<p>O men, why do we vainly we ourselves disquiet?
the course we run is quick and hard:
life is as smoke: soon vapour, dust, and ashes
we shall be; and as a flower shall fade. Therefore
let us to the immortal Christ exclaim, Rest
him remov’d from us where is the dwelling-place
of all that joy.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Glory. Both now. Theotokion.</i></p>

<p>God-bearing Virgin, we, we tempest-tost upon
life’s sea, thee as salvation’s haven have. Therefore
pray God, who seedlessly from thee incarnate
was, and man became unspeakably, to save
our souls.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Stichera, tone iv.</i></p>

<p>Where is the predilection of the world?
where their imaginings who fade? where is
the silver and the gold? where servants’ multitude
and noise? All dust, all ashes, all a shade.
But, come ye, let us say to the immortal King,
O Lord, him, who hath been remov’d from us,
of thine eternal blessings worthy count, him
resting in thine ageless happiness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span></p>

<p><i>Verse.</i> I was glad when they said unto me,
Let us go into the house of the Lord.</p>

<p>Death as a robber came, like as a thief he
came, and laid me low; he came, and me
declar’d as one existing not; he came, and,
being earth, I lie as being not. We verily are
a dream, O men, a phantom verily. But, come
ye, let us cry to the immortal King, O Lord,
vouchsafe thine everlasting blessings unto him
remov’d from us, him resting in the life that
grows not old.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Glory. Both now. Theotokion.</i></p>

<p>O only pure and spotless Virgin, who without
seed didst bring forth God, pray that our souls
be sav’d.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Stichera, tone v.</i></p>

<p>I remember’d what the prophet said, I am
earth and I am dust; and again I meditated in
the graves, and saw the naked bones, and said,
Who now is king, or, warrior, who; or, who is
rich, or, who is poor; or, who the just, or, he
that sinn’d? But, with the just, thy servant rest,
O Lord.</p>

<p><i>Verse.</i> Our feet have stood in thy courts, O
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Thou, Christ, hast said that he in thee
believing shall not death behold: but, as I out
of light in light am light, so shall ye also in
my glory be enlightened in me; for I, that am
true God, have come to save them that revere<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
me in true right-belief, me, one Lord God, in
dual nature of deity and flesh, but one in
essence. Therefore, thy faithful servant, who
thus confesseth thee, rest in thy countenance’s
light among the Saints, as lover of mankind.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Glory. Both now. Theotokion.</i></p>

<p>We thee beseech, as Mother of God, O
blessed one, Pray thou for us, that we be sav’d.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Stichera, tone vi.</i></p>

<p>To me thy life-effecting bidding was substance
and origin; for, willing me to form a
living one from nature that unseen is and is
seen, my body thou didst make of earth, and,
by thy breathing life-creating and divine, me
gavest soul. Therefore, O Christ, thy servant
rest in tract of them that living are, and in the
dwellings of the just.</p>

<p><i>Verse.</i> Unto thee have I lifted up mine eyes,
O thou that dwellest in heaven.</p>

<p>That which thy hands did frame thou with
thine image honour’d hast, O Word; for, in
material form inscribing livingly a mental
essence’s similitude, of this me also thou hast
made participant, placing me on the earth to
be, of mine own power, creation’s lord. Therefore,
thy servant, Saviour, rest in tract of them
that living are, and in the dwellings of the just.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Glory. Both now. Theotokion.</i></p>

<p>God-bearing Virgin, we have understood the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
God made flesh from thee, whom do thou pray
to save our souls.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Stichera, tone vii.</i></p>

<p>After thine image and resemblance in the
beginning making man, in paradise thou him
didst place to be of thy creation lord; but, by
the devil’s enviousness beguil’d, he ate the fruit,
transgressing thy commands. Therefore again
to earth, whence he was taken, thou hast doom’d
him to return, O Lord, and beg for rest.</p>

<p><i>Verse.</i> How amiable are thy tabernacles,
O Lord of hosts.</p>

<p>Death looseth every grief befalling Adam’s
nature; for corrupt we have become, partaking
of the food. Then let us learn, form’d out of
earth, we dust and ashes shall become, like as
we were before. Therefore let us with wailing
voice our Maker pray pardon and mercy to
bestow on him removed hence.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Glory. Both now. Theotokion.</i></p>

<p>Thee, O God-bearing one, we faithful have
as an unbroken wall and trust. Therefore, cease
not, O Queen, to pray for them thy servants
that in faith have slept, that in the judgment
there may pardon be for them, when he thy
Son and God shall sit; for thou dost nature
know, that it with every sin is now commix’d:
so may we bless thee all.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Stichera, tone viii.</i></p>

<p>I weep and I lament when I reflect on death,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
and see the comeliness, according to God’s
image, that was shap’d for us lying in the
graves disfigur’d, and bereft of glory and of
form. O wonder! what is this mystery concerning
us? how to corruption have we been
assign’d? how unto death conjoin’d? Verily by
God’s command, as it is written, who giveth
the departed rest.</p>

<p>Bearing an image incorrupt, and having an
immortal soul received by breath divine, and so
become compound, as it is written, why do we
fade away? and why did we God’s bidding
overstep? O wonder! why did we leave the
food of life, and eat the fruit that bringeth
bitter death? why, by guile, have we been
robb’d of life divine? As for the rest, let us
exclaim to Christ, Him whom thou hast removed
hence place in thy courts.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Glory. Both now. Theotokion.</i></p>

<p>God-bearing Virgin, thy protection is a
spiritual healing place; for thereunto betaking
us, we are set free from ailments of the soul.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Stichera, tone viii. Idiomela.</i></p>

<p>To them that prodigally live unmeasur’d torment
is, gnashing of teeth, and wailing unconsol’d,
gloom unillum’d, and darkness most profound,
the never dying worm, and unavailing
tears, and, without mercy, doom. Therefore
let us, before the end, lift up our voice, and say,
O Master Christ, him who thou chosen hast
give rest with thine elect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Similar.</i></p>

<p>The trumpet shall give sound, and, as from
sleep, the dead shall rise, desiring to obtain
the heavenly life, they who have put their trust
in thee, the Maker and the Lord. Then, O
condemn thy servant not; for thou, immortal
one, for our sake mortal didst become. Therefore
let us, before the end, lift up our voice,
and say, O Master Christ, him whom thou
chosen hast, give rest with thine elect.</p>

<p>Behold, the elements, the heaven and earth
shall be transform’d, and all creation shall with
incorruption clothed be. Corruption shall be
done away, and darkness at thine advent fly;
for thou with glory art to come again, as it is
written, to render unto each as he hath done.
O Master Christ, him whom thou chosen hast,
give rest with thine elect.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Glory, tone vi.</i></p>

<p>O come ye all and see a strange and fearful
sight made manifest to all, the image now beheld,
and vex yourselves no more with transient
things. To-day divided from the body is a
soul, and is translated to th’ eternal world; for
in a way it goeth wherein never yet it went, and
to the Judge who no respect of persons hath,
where stand the Angels’ hosts. My brethren,
fearful is that judgment-seat, where naked all
of us shall stand, and some be crown’d and some
be sham’d. Then let us to th’ immortal King<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>

translated onto thee, and hast said, Suffer the

<p>Verily everything is vain, and life a shadow
is, a dream; for vainly every earth-born one disquieteth
himself, as saith the scripture. When
we have gain’d the world, then dwell we in the
grave, where kings and beggars, elders and
babes together are. Therefore, Christ God,
as lover of mankind, rest the departed babe.</p>

<p><i>Refrain.</i> Rest thou the babe, O Lord.</p>

<p>We wail not for the babes, but rather for
ourselves do we lament, we, who have always
sinn’d, that we may be delivered from gehenna.</p>

<p>Thou, Master, hast depriv’d the babe of the
delights of earth: do thou, as righteous judge,
vouchsafe him heavenly blessings.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Glory.</i></p>

<p>He hath declared thee a citizen of paradise,
O truly happy babe, he who hath taken thee
from earth and ranged thee among the choirs
of Saints.</p>

<p>Why hast thou rejected me....</p>

<p><i>Refrain.</i> Rest thou the babe, O Lord.</p>

<p>By thy just dooming, ere he waxed perfectly
in growth, thou hast, as new grown herb, cut
down the babe whom thou hast taken, Lord;
but, leading him, O Word, to hill divine of
everlasting blessings, plant him there.</p>

<p>As a young branch the sword of death hath
come and cut thee off, thou who of worldly
sweets no trial hast sustain’d, thou happy one!
but, lo, to thee the gates of heaven Christ
open’d hath, counting thee with th’ elect, as
being loving-kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span></p>

have begun for weeping to be meet; but
rather weep ye alway for yourselves, ye who
have sinn’d, O kinsfolk and O friends, the
dead babe cries, so that of torment ye have no
essay.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Both now.</i></p>

<p>I am despairing of myself when on the
number of my deeds I muse; but when in mind
I bear thee, Mother of God, who above mind
didst bear the Lord, I am refresh’d with hope;
for we have thee a sole defence.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Ode vi. Irmos.</i></p>

<p>I will pour forth a prayer before the Lord,
and to him will I tell my grief; for my soul is
full of evils, and my life draweth nigh unto
hades, and I pray as Jonas, O God, raise me
out of corruption.</p>

<p><i>Refrain.</i> Rest thou the babe, O Lord.</p>

<p>Thou was laid in a manger as a babe, and
wast plac’d in an elder’s arms, who generatest
babes in the womb; and ere this one attain’d
perfect growth, thou hast bidden him to thee.
Then we with thanksgiving extol thee.</p>

<p>Thou didst say to the apostles, O Word, Let
the children come unto me; for my kingdom
is for them that are such in wiseness. Then
count the babe remov’d to thee of thy light
worthy.</p>

O Good One, we extol thy judgments’ depth
unmeasur’d.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Both now. Theotokion.</i></p>

<p>We have thee, Maiden, as a sheltering wall,

<p>Thyself alone immortal art, who madest and

fashion’d were, and unto that same earth shall
go, as thou who madest me hast given command,
and sayest unto me, Earth thou art, and unto
earth shalt thou return. And thither all we
mortals go, making the funeral wail, even the

<p>More sympathetic than a mother there is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
none, and than a father more compassionate

the babes accompany hence: great is the sting
which for the children’s sake their hearts receive,
and still the more when these sweet-spoken
are, and they their words remember
with the song, the Alleluia.</p>

<p>For oft beside the grave they smite their
breasts, and say, O thou my son and sweetest
child! hearest thou not thy mother what she
saith? lo, ’tis the womb that thee hath borne:
why dost thou speak not as thou wert wont to
speak to us? But so thou silent art, even to say
with us the Alleluia.</p>

<p>O God, O God, who callest me, be now the
comfort of my house, for great the wailing is
befalling them; for they all have regard to me,
even they who have me as a sole-begotten
one. But thou who wast of Virgin Mother born,
refresh the bowels of my mother, and bedew
my father’s heart, even with this, the Alleluia.</p>

in places of refreshment where living water is,
may Christ thee place, yea, he who for our sake
became a child, even ours who unto him cry
ceaselessly, O priests, extol him, and, O people,
set him up for aye.</p>

<p>A constant cause of grief to us, yea, and for

things that give delight thou hast left earth,
yea, and thy parents’ breasts. But Abraham’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>

of every stain.</p>

<p>Why mourn ye me, a babe, that hence is
gone? lying he cries invisibly: for I am wont
not to be mourn’d; for destin’d is the joy of
all the just for babes: to them that works perform
not there meetness is for tears. But those
the song upraise to Christ, O priests, extol him,
and, O people, set him up for aye.</p>

from the dreadful doom, the grave essay, the
darkness, and the fire, the gnashing of the
teeth, the contumely of demons, and from
every need, thou hope of them that have no
hope, thou, the despairing’s life.</p>

didst send and take the happy babe as a pure
bird to heavenly nest, thou hast from diverse
snares preserv’d his soul, and join’d it with the
righteous souls thy kingdom’s sweets that taste.</p>

<p>To babes that nothing have perform’d, O

thee, because of the Lord thy God and the

For my counsels are not as your counsels,
neither as your ways are my ways, saith the

For as the rain or the snow cometh down from
heaven, and returneth not thither, until it
soaketh the earth, and generateth, and increaseth,
and giveth seed to the sower, and
bread to the eater, so shall my word be which

me void, until it accomplisheth all that I have
wished, and furthereth my ways and my commandments.

<p class="dropcap">Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son,
that art in the bosom of the Father, O thou
true God, fountain of life and immortality,
thou light of light, that camest into the world<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
to enlighten it; do thou dawn upon our mind
by thy Holy Ghost, and accept us offering
magnifying and thanksgiving unto thee for thy
wonderful mighty works from eternity, and for
thy saving providence in these last ages, in
which thou hast assumed our impotent and
poor substance, and, condescending to the
estate of a servant, who art King of all things,
didst furthermore endure to be baptized in
Jordan by the hand of a servant, that thou, the
sinless one, having sanctified the nature of
water, mightest lead us unto regeneration by
water and the spirit, and stablish us in the
aforetime liberty. And, celebrating the memory
of this divine mystery, we beseech thee, O
man-loving Master, Sprinkle thou also upon us,
thine unworthy servants, according to thy divine
promise, pure water, the gift of thy tenderness,
that the prayer of us sinners over this water
may be acceptable through thy grace, and that
thereby thy blessing may be bestowed upon us
and upon all thy faithful people, to the glory of
thy holy and adorable name. For to thee is
due all glory, honour, and worship, with thine
unbeginning Father, and with thy most holy, and
good, and life-creating Spirit, now and ever,
and to ages of ages.</p>

<p><i>And he saith to himself</i>, Amen.</p>

<p><i>And when the deacon hath finished the ectenia,
the priest beginneth this prayer with a loud voice.</i></p>

<p>Great art thou, O Lord, and wonderful are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
thy works, and no word shall be sufficient for
the praise of thy wonders.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Thrice.</i></p>

<p>For thou by thy will hast from, nothingness
brought all things into being, and, by thy
power, thou sustainest creation, and, by thy
foreknowledge, directest the world. Thou
from four elements hast formed creation, and
hast crowned the circle of the year with four
seasons. All the spiritual powers tremble before
thee, the sun praiseth thee, the moon
glorifieth thee, the stars make intercession with
thee, the light hearkeneth unto thee, the depths
shudder at thy presence, the springs of water
serve thee. Thou hast stretched out the heavens
as a curtain, thou hast founded the earth upon
the waters, thou hast bounded the sea with
sand, thou hast diffused the air for breathing.
The angelic powers minister unto thee, the
choirs of archangels worship thee, the many-eyed
cherubim, and the six-winged seraphim,
standing and flying around, cover themselves
with fear of thine unapproachable glory. For
thou, being the uninscribable, unbeginning and
unspeakable God, didst come down upon earth,
taking the form of a servant, being made in the
likeness of men; for thou, O Master, through
the tenderness of thy mercy, didst not endure to
behold the race of men tormented by the devil,
but thou didst come and save us. We confess
thy grace, we proclaim thy mercy, we conceal
not thy beneficence. Thou hast set at liberty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
the generations of our nature, thou didst hallow
the virginal womb by thy birth. All creation
praiseth thee who didst manifest thyself; for
thou, O our God, wast seen upon earth, and
didst dwell together with men. Thou didst
hallow the streams of Jordan, sending down
from heaven thy Holy Ghost, and didst crush
the heads of the dragons that lurked therein.</p>

<p><i>And the priest then saith this thrice, and blesseth
the water with his hand at each verse.</i></p>

<p>Do thou thyself, O man-loving King, be
present now also through the descent of thy
Holy Ghost, and sanctify this water.</p>

<p>And give it the grace of redemption, the
blessing of Jordan. Make it a fountain of
incorruption, a gift of sanctification, a loosing
of sins, a healing of sicknesses, a destruction
of demons, unapproachable by hostile powers,
fulfilled with angelic strength, that all they that
draw and partake thereof may have it for the
cleansing of souls and bodies, for the healing of
sufferings, for the sanctification of houses, and
for every befitting need. For thou art our God,
who through water and the spirit hast renewed
our nature fallen through sin: thou art our God,
who through water didst overwhelm sin in the
time of Noe: thou art our God, who through
the sea by Moses didst deliver the Hebrew race
from the servitude of Pharao: thou art our God,
who didst divide the rock in the wilderness,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
and it gushed waters and poured streams, and
satisfied thy thirsty people: thou art our God,
who through water and fire by Elias didst convert
Israel from the error of Baal.</p>

<p>And do thou thyself now, O Master, sanctify
this water by thy Holy Ghost.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Thrice.</i></p>

<p>And grant unto all them that touch it, and
partake thereof, and are sprinkled therewith,
sanctification, healing, cleansing, and blessing.</p>

<p>Save, O Lord, thy Servant, our Most Pious,
Autocratic Great Lord, THE EMPEROR
ALEXANDER ALEXANDROVITCH of all

became a man, in Jordan for our cleansing
cleansed was, himself alone being pure and
uncorrupt, me hallowing and the waters, and
the dragons’ heads crushing the water in. Then,
brethren, let us water draw with joy; for unto

<p><i>He that is to be made a taper-bearer is brought
by two subdeacons into the middle of the church,
and he maketh three reverences. And, turning himself,
he boweth thrice to the Archpriest; and, having
been conducted to the Archpriest, he boweth his head,
and the Archpriest signeth him crosswise with the
hand upon his head thrice. And after this, placing
his hand upon his head, he saith this prayer.</i></p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-l.jpg" alt=" ">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Lord, who with the light of thy wonders
enlightenest all Creation, who knowest the
intention of each before it is formed, and
strengthenest them that desire to serve thee;
do thou thyself adorn with thine unspotted and
undefiled robes thy servant, <i>name</i>, who is
minded to precede thy holy mysteries as a
taper-bearer, that, being enlightened and meeting
thee in the world to come, he may obtain
an incorruptible crown of life, rejoicing with
thine elect in everlasting blessedness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Appendix_Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p><i>Exclamation.</i> For hallowed is thy name, and
glorified is thy kingdom, of the Father, and of
the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, now and ever,
and to ages of ages. Amen.</p>

<p><i>And be it noted that, if the liturgy be not celebrated,
the Archpriest maketh the beginning</i>, Blessed
be our God.... <i>and then is sung</i>, O heavenly
King.... <i>Trisagion.</i> O most holy Trinity.... Our
Father.... For thine is the kingdom....
<i>And the troparion of the day is said.</i></p>

<p><i>But if the liturgy be celebrated</i>, O heavenly
King.... <i>and Trisagion and</i> Our Father.... <i>are
not sung, and only these troparia are said.</i></p>

<p>O holy apostles, pray the merciful God that
he may grant our souls remission of sins.</p>

<p>The grace of thy mouth, shining forth like fire,
hath illuminated the universe, hath offered the
world treasures of liberality, and hath shewed to
us the height of humility. And as thou instructest
by thy words, O father John Chrysostom,
pray Christ, the Word of God, to save our souls.</p>

<p>Thy sound is gone forth into all the earth,
which hath received thy word, whereby thou
hast divinely taught, hast explained the nature
of things that are, and brightened the customs
of men, O royal divine, venerable father: pray
thou Christ God to save our souls.</p>

<p>The shepherd’s reed of thy divinity hath
overcome the trumpets of the orators; for as to
him that seeketh the deep things of the spirit,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Appendix_Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
so was the grace of language accorded thee.
Then, father Gregory, pray Christ God to save
our souls.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Glory. Both now.</i></p>

<p>Through the prayers, O Lord, of all the
saints, and of the God-bearing one, grant thy
peace to us, and have mercy upon us, as being
alone compassionate.</p>

<p><i>Then the Archpriest sheareth his head crosswise,
saying</i>, In the name of the Father. <i>A protodeacon
and a reader, or a singer, say</i>, Amen. <i>Archpriest.</i>
And of the Son. <i>Protodeacon.</i> Amen. <i>Archpriest.</i>
And of the Holy Ghost. <i>Protodeacon.</i>
Amen.</p>

<p><i>Then the Archpriest putteth the short phelonion
on him, and again thrice signeth him crosswise on
his head with the hand, and layeth his hand upon
him, and prayeth thus,</i></p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-o.jpg" alt=" ">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">O Lord God almighty, elect this thy servant,
and sanctify him, and grant unto him, in
all wisdom and understanding, to practise
the study and reading of thy divine words,
preserving him in a blameless course of life.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Exclamation.</i></p>

<p>Through the mercy, and compassions, and
love to man of thine only-begotten Son, with
whom thou art blessed, together with thine all-holy,
and good, and life-creating Spirit, now
and ever, and to ages of ages. Amen.</p>

<p><i>And after the prayer the Archpriest openeth the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Appendix_Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
book of the apostles over the head of the reader. And
the subdeacons conduct him from the Archpriest, and
place him in the middle of the church, with his face
towards the east, and give him the book of the
apostles, and he readeth thus, The reading of the
message of the holy apostle Paul to the Romans (or,
to others). And he readeth the portion of the
epistle that is appointed, from the beginning to the
end, and turneth himself and boweth thrice to the
Archpriest according to rite. And the subdeacons
take off from him the phelonion, and conduct him to
the Archpriest. And the Archpriest again signeth
his head thrice with the hand. And they bring the
sticharion to the Archpriest, and he signeth the
sticharion with his hand over the cross. And he
that hath been appointed, having signed himself
with his hand, kisseth the cross upon the sticharion,
and the hand of the Archpriest; and the subdeacons
vest him with the sticharion. And the
Archpriest addresseth him on this wise,</i></p>

<p>Child, the first degree of the priesthood is
that of reader. Therefore it becometh thee to
read every day in the divine scriptures, that they
that hear, considering thee, may receive edification,
and that thou, in nowise shaming thine
election, mayest prepare thyself for a more advanced
degree. For, living temperately, holily,
and righteously, thou shalt gain the mercy of
the man-loving God, and make thyself worthy
of a higher ministry, in Christ Jesus our Lord,
to whom be glory to ages of ages. Amen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Appendix_Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Then the Archpriest saith on this wise,</i></p>

<p>Blessed be the Lord, lo, the servant of God,
<i>name</i>, becometh reader of the most holy church,
<i>name</i>, in the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p><i>And the Archpriest giveth him a lamp, and he
standeth before the Archpriest with the lamp in the
indicated place.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>And if there be several readers to receive the laying<br>
on of hands they receive this together,<br>
and the prayer is said in the<br>
plural.</i></p>

<h3 id="SUBDEACON">THE OFFICE THAT IS USED AT THE LAYING ON OF HANDS OF A SUBDEACON.</h3>

<p><i>Now if on the same day he is to receive the laying
on of hands for the subdiaconate, after the investing
with the sticharion, the subdeacons bring a
sticharion-girdle to the Archpriest. And the Archpriest
maketh the sign of the cross upon the girdle,
and he that is to receive the laying on of hands
kisseth the girdle, and the hand of the Archpriest,
and they gird him. And the Archpriest signeth
him with the hand upon the head thrice. After
this the protodeacon saith</i>, Let us pray to the
Lord. <i>And the Archpriest, having laid his hand
upon him, saith this prayer.</i></p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-o.jpg" alt=" ">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">O Lord our God, who through one and the
same holy Spirit, distributest gifts to them
whom thou hast chosen, bestowing various<span class="pagenum"><a id="Appendix_Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
orders in thy church, and appointing degrees of
service therein for the ministration of thy divine
and spotless mysteries, who, in thine unspeakable
foreknowledge, dost also appoint this thy
servant to be worthy to serve in thy holy church;
do thou thyself, O Master, preserve him blameless
in all things, and grant unto him to love
the beauty of thy house, to stand at the doors
of thy holy temple, to kindle the lamp of the
tabernacle of thy glory; and plant him in thy
holy church as a fruitful olive-tree that beareth
fruit of righteousness; and, at the time of thine
advent, declare thy servant perfected to receive
the reward of them that have been acceptable
unto thee.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Exclamation.</i></p>

<p>For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and
the glory, of the Father, and of the Son, and of
the Holy Ghost, now and ever, and to ages of
ages. Amen.</p>

<p><i>And after the prayer the subdeacons give a ewer
to him that is receiving the laying on of hands,
and lay a towel upon his shoulder; and the Archpriest
washeth his hands. And he that is receiving
the laying on of hands for subdeacon poureth water
on the hands of the Archpriest. After this he that
is receiving the laying on of hands, and the other
subdeacons, kiss the Archpriest’s hand, and betake
themselves from him to the indicated place. And
he that is receiving the laying on of hands for
subdeacon standeth, holding the ewer, and the wash-hand
basin, together with the towel, until the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Appendix_Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
cherubic hymn. And he saith, Trisagion.</i> O
most holy Trinity.... Our Father.... Lord,
have mercy. I believe in one God....
Forgive, remit.... <i>and whatever else he is minded
to say secretly. And during the cherubic hymn he is
conducted before the royal doors to the Archpriest; and
the Archpriest washeth his hands according to rite,
and saith the prayer. Then he signeth the water
with his hand crosswise thrice. And the Archpriest
with this sanctified water wetteth his eyes, ears,
nostrils, and lips. And at the great introit he
walketh behind all the ministers. And when the
Archpriest taketh up the holy things, and all the
ministers proceed into the altar, he that is receiving
the laying on of hands for subdeacon boweth to the
Archpriest, and beareth water to the right and left
choirs, and to the people, and they all splash themselves
with this water. And they conduct him
back to the altar, and they pour the water that
remaineth into the piscina. And, being conducted,
he remaineth before the royal doors, and standeth in
the indicated place according to rite. And when the
Archpriest hath said</i>, And may the mercies....
<i>after this exclamation he is conducted into the
altar by the subdeacons according to rite, and,
having received a blessing from the Archpriest, he
standeth with the subdeacons.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>After the Archpriest hath said,</i></p>

<p>And may the mercies of the great God....
<i>the subdeacons bring forward the throne, and
place it before the holy table, but somewhat on the
left side, so that they may not turn their backs towards
the holy things. And the Archpriest seateth
himself thereupon, and they take him that is to
receive the laying on of hands from the middle of
the church, two subdeacons holding him between
them, each of them laying one hand upon his neck,
and with the other hand holding him by the hands,
and they bow him down as lowly as possible. And
a deacon in the altar saith</i>, Bid. <i>Then, having
advanced somewhat, they bow him down as before.
And another deacon saith</i>, Bid ye. <i>Then they
come nigh unto the holy gates of the altar, and bow
him down before the Archpriest.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>And the protodeacon saith,</i></p>

<p class="center">Bid, right reverend master.</p>

<p><i>And the subdeacons leave him that is to receive
the laying on of hands at the royal gates, and two
receive him, a protodeacon and a deacon, one by the
right and the other by the left hand, and he boweth
himself to the Archpriest. And the Archpriest
signeth him with the hand crosswise, and they conduct
him round the holy table, they that lead him
and the others singing,</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Appendix_Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>O holy martyrs, who valiantly contended, and
are crown’d; pray ye the Lord for mercy on our
souls.</p>

<p><i>Then they that are without sing the same once.
And he that is receiving the laying on of hands
kisseth the four corners of the holy table, and the
hand of the Archpriest, and his knee. Then they
conduct him round again, singing,</i></p>

<p>Glory to thee, Christ God, apostles’ boast,
and martyrs’ joy, whose preaching was the consubstantial
Trinity.</p>

<p><i>And the choir without singeth the same once.
And he that is receiving the laying on of hands
again kisseth the holy table in like manner as
before, and the Archpriest’s epigonation, and his
hand.</i></p>

<p><i>Then again they conduct him round, singing,</i></p>

<p>Rejoice, O Esaias, the virgin is with child,
and bringeth forth a son, Emmanuel, God and
man: the orient is his name, whom magnifying,
we call the virgin blessed.</p>

<p><i>And they make the rite, as before written. And
they sing the same without. Then the Archpriest
riseth, and they remove the throne, and he that is
receiving the laying on of hands goeth to the right
side of the Archpriest, and boweth himself before
the holy table thrice, saying</i>, O God, cleanse me, a
sinner. <i>And, bending the right knee, he placeth his
palms crosswise on the holy table, and layeth also his
forehead between his hands on the holy table. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Appendix_Page_14"></a>[14]</span>

attend, <i>the Archpriest, holding his hand upon his
head, readeth aloud in the hearing of all them that
stand in the altar,</i></p>

<p>The divine grace, which always remedieth
that which is feeble, and supplieth that which
is lacking, layeth hands upon, <i>name</i>, the most

the left hand side, the same thrice. And the singers
without, in the right and left choirs</i>, Kyrie eleison,

readeth the prayer. Then the Archpriest blesseth
him upon the head thrice, holding his hand upon
the head of him that is receiving the laying on of
hands. The protodeacon saith</i>, Let us pray to the
Lord, <i>in a low voice.</i></p>

saith the second prayer.</i></p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-o.jpg" alt=" ">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">O God our Saviour, who, by thine incorruptible
voice, didst appoint the law of the diaconate
unto thine apostles, and didst declare the
protomartyr Stephen of such rank, and proclaim
him the first to fulfil the work of a deacon, as it
is written in thy holy gospel, Whosoever desireth
to be the first among you, let him be your
minister; do thou, O Master of all, fill this thy
servant, whom thou hast made worthy to enter
on the ministry of a deacon, with all faith, and
love, and power, and sanctification, through the
visitation of thy holy and life-creating Spirit
(for it is not by the imposition of my hands,
but by the presence of thy compassions, that
grace is given unto them that are worthy of
thee), that he, being without any sin, may
stand blameless before thee in the fearful day
of thy judgment, and may receive the unfailing
reward of thy promise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Appendix_Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<p><i>Exclamation.</i> For thou art our God, and to
thee we ascribe glory, to the Father, and to
the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, now and ever,
and to ages of ages. Amen.</p>

<p><i>Then they raise him up, and loosen his girding.
And the Archpriest, taking the orarion, layeth it
upon his left shoulder saying with a loud voice,</i>
Axios. <i>And they sing in the altar thrice</i>, Axios.
<i>And in like manner without by both choirs. Then
the maniples are given him, and the Archpriest
saith</i>, Axios. <i>And they sing the same in the altar
thrice, and in like manner without. Then the fan
is given him, and the Archpriest saith</i>, Axios. <i>And
they sing in the altar and without according to
custom. And he kisseth the Archpriest on the
shoulder, and placeth himself by the altar, and
fanneth the holy things.</i></p>

<h3 id="ARCHDEACON_AND_PROTODEACON">THE OFFICE THAT IS USED AT THE APPOINTMENT OF AN ARCHDEACON AND A PROTODEACON.</h3>

<p><i>He that is to be appointed an archdeacon is led
by a protodeacon and a deacon unto the right
reverend Archpriest in the middle of the church,
where the Archpriest is standing at the time of the
introit with the gospel; and he inclineth himself
to his girdle before the Archpriest thrice, and boweth
his head. And the Archpriest, sitting, signeth him
with the hand on his head crosswise, thrice; and,
rising, he layeth his hand upon his head. And the
deacon having said</i>, Let us pray to the Lord,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Appendix_Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>the Archpriest saith this prayer.</i></p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-m.jpg" alt=" ">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Master, Lord our God, who, by thine unspeakable
providence, hast given to our
race archdeaconship, that they that are
endued therewith may command and serve,
with the subordinate ministers at thy divine
mysteries; do thou thyself endue with this
grace of archdeaconship thy present servant,
<i>name</i>, and adorn him with thy virtue to stand
at the head of the deacons of thy people,
and to be a good example to them that are
under him. And make him to attain unto a
ripe old age to glorify thy majestic name, of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,
now and ever, and to ages of ages. Amen.</p>

<p><i>Then the Archpriest signeth his head crosswise,
saying</i>, Blessed be the Lord, lo, the servant of
God, <i>name</i>, is archdeacon (or protodeacon) in
the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of
the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p><i>And the Archpriest, laying his hand upon his
head, exclaimeth</i>, Axios, <i>thrice. And the singers
sing</i>, Axios, <i>thrice. And they enter the altar
according to rite.</i></p>

<h3 id="PRESBYTER">THE OFFICE THAT IS USED AT THE LAYING ON OF HANDS OF A PRESBYTER.</h3>

<p><i>After the conclusion of the cherubic hymn, he

archdeacon, or by one of the other deacons, through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Appendix_Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
the royal gates unto the holy table before the Archpriest
on the right hand side. And the Archpriest
signeth him with the hand crosswise, and he is
conducted round the throne thrice, as it is written in
the diaconal laying on of hands, while all in the
altar sing these troparia.</i></p>

<p>O holy martyrs, who valiantly contended and
are crown’d; pray ye the Lord for mercy on
out souls.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Once.</i></p>

<p>Glory to thee, Christ God, apostles’ boast and
martyrs’ joy, whose preaching was the consubstantial
Trinity.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Once.</i></p>

<p><i>Then</i>, Rejoice, O Esaias, the virgin is with
child, and bringeth forth a son, Emmanuel,
God and man: the orient is his name, whom
magnifying, we call the virgin blessed.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Once.</i></p>

<p><i>And he bendeth both knees, and placeth his palms
crosswise on the holy table, and layeth his forehead
between his hands on the holy table. The Archpriest
placeth the end of the omophorion on the head
of him that is receiving the laying on of hands, and
blesseth him upon the head thrice. And the leading
priest having said</i>, Let us attend, <i>the Archpriest,
holding his hand upon his head, readeth aloud in
the hearing of all them, that stand in the altar,</i></p>

<p>The divine grace, which always remedieth
that which is feeble, and supplieth that which
is lacking, layeth hands upon, <i>name</i>, the most
pious deacon, to be presbyter: let us therefore
pray for him, that the grace of the all-holy
Spirit may come upon him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Appendix_Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p><i>And the priests within sing</i>, Lord, have mercy,
<i>thrice from the right hand side. Then again thrice
from the left hand side. Then in like manner also
the singers without in the right and left choirs,</i>
Kyrie eleison, <i>antiphonally thrice slowly, while
the Archpriest readeth the prayer. The Archpriest
again blesseth him thrice, having his hand lying
upon the head of him that is receiving the laying
on of hands. And the protodeacon saith</i>, Let us
pray to the Lord, <i>in a low voice.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>The Archpriest saith the prayer secretly.</i></p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-o.jpg" alt=" ">

<p class="dropcap">O God, unbeginning and unending, who art
older than every created thing, who honourest
with the tide of presbyter them who are
made worthy in this degree to minister sacredly
the word of thy truth; do thou thyself, O Master
of all, vouchsafe that this man, whom thou art
well-pleased to lay hands upon by me, may
receive, in a blameless conversation and in
unswerving faith, this great grace of thy holy
Spirit, and declare him thy perfect servant,
acceptable unto thee in all things, and worthily

<p><i>And the priest readeth that which is of peace in
a low voice.</i></p>

<p>In peace let us pray to the Lord. <i>They
answer to each petition</i>, Lord, have mercy, <i>once</i>.
For the peace that is from above.... For
the peace of the whole world.... For our
archpriest, <i>name</i>, for his priesthood, assistance,
continuance, peace, health, salvation, and for
the work of his hands, let us pray to the Lord.
For the Servant of God, <i>name</i>, now receiving
the laying on of hands for presbyter, and for his
salvation, let us pray to the Lord. That the
man-loving God may bestow on him a spotless
and blameless priesthood, let us pray to the
Lord. For our Most Pious, Autocratic Great
Lord, THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER
ALEXANDROVITCH of all Russia, and for all
HIS palace and army, let us pray to the Lord.
For this city.... For our deliverance.... Help
us, save us.... Commemorating our

<p class="dropcap">O God, mighty in power, and unsearchable
in understanding, wonderful in counsels
above the sons of men; do thou thyself, O
Lord, fill with the gift of thy holy Spirit this
man, whom thou art well-pleased should attain
unto the presbyterial degree, that he may be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Appendix_Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
worthy to stand blamelessly at thine altar, to
declare the gospel of thy kingdom, to minister
sacredly the word of thy truth, to offer unto
thee gifts and spiritual sacrifices, and to renew
thy people by the laver of regeneration, that he,
meeting thee at the second coming of the great
God and our Saviour, Jesus Christ, thine only-begotten
